what this script does:
----
has a 5/6/7/8 letters option
----
pretty much generates a clean name depending on how many letters you chose
----
has a copy button (very cool ik)
----

PLEASE NOTE:
----
This script works with a roblox executor, it does not work in roblox studio.
----
If you plan on using your main account to execute it, join 1 of your roblox games that you've got ownership over so you can avoid getting banned.
----
Either way use an alt account.
----

this is discontinued because ill probs rewrite it, but ill leave the old version here on this repo
----
the new version is gonna include much more stuff, and its gonna look cleaner, no spoils
----


paste this on your executor:
----
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s-ane/rblx-name-generator/refs/heads/main/script.lua"))();
